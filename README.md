# Personal Website 2020

With the new year, I've decided to focus energies into working on my personal website once more.

As such, for the purposes of maintaining my own homepage with ease, I have chosen to greatly simplify
the website such that all I need to edit it is to know standard HTML and CSS.

UPDATE:

I eventually decided to just implement this and continue working on this in GatsbyJS.
