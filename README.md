# Personal Website 2020

With the new year, I've decided to focus energies into working on my personal website once more.
My previous website, though I am proud of it on some level, is a basic boilerplate GatsbyJS site
that I admittedly am unable to maintain due to a poor knowledge of both ReactJS and Gatsby.

As such, for the purposes of maintaining my own homepage with ease, I have chosen to greatly simplify
the website such that all I need to edit it is to know standard HTML and CSS.
