        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            I am Joshua Faria, I am a recent graduate from the University of
            North Florida with a Bachelors Degree in Computer and Information
            Science.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I had to describe myself with some sort of title, it would be an
            amateur developer
          </p>
          <p>
            I would consider myself fairly skilled as a problem solver. That I
            am able to both have a problem, work out a solution to that problem,
            and to be able to bring myself to the task of finding all necessary
            Information to adequately solve it. However, I can not with
            certainty say that I am truly exceptionally proficient in the
            languages I have used. Only that I have confidence in my ability to
            learn.
