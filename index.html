        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            I am Joshua Faria, I am a recent graduate from the University of
            North Florida with a Bachelors Degree in Computer and Information
            Science.
          </p>

          <p>
            If I had to describe myself with some sort of title, it would be an
            amateur developer
          </p>

          <p>
            I am a curious person, always looking into topics and personal
            research to see how things work and why things are done. I'm also
            the kind of person who if he see's a problem, I immediatley look for
            solutions, scoping out all possibilities and becoming fairly
            acquainted with my issue.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm always looking to learn new things, open to new ideas, and
            constantly motivated to understanding new concepts, tools, and
            improving my means of productivity.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my spare time these days, I'm usually gawking at the latest tech.
            Be it the hottest new graphics card, the next step in AMD's ZEN
            architecture, the rise of Linux as a highly viable OS for gaming, or
            just looking for the next big game to sink hours into.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next game at this moment I'm looking forward to is Doom Eternal
