            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              I am Joshua Faria, I am a recent graduate from the University of
              North Florida with a Bachelors Degree in Computer and Information
              Science.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I had to describe myself with some sort of title, it would be
              an amateur developer
            </p>
            <p>
              I would consider myself fairly skilled as a problem solver. That I
              am able to both have a problem, work out a solution to that
              problem, and to be able to bring myself to the task of finding all
              necessary Information to adequately solve it. However, I can not
              with certainty say that I am truly exceptionally proficient in the
              languages I have used. Only that I have confidence in my ability
              to learn.

            <h2>Senior Project - CPAT</h2>
            <p>
              My Senior Project in University was a two semester long course
              where me and three other students assisted a local member of the
              Florida community with a non-mission crital aspect of a project
              they wanted us to work on.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project, the Course Planning and Advising Tool, was to provide
              a more meaningful plan so that students could better assess their
              education. An issue had by many schools is with the demand for
              students to graduate on average, that is to say within four years
              for a Bachelors Degree. It is understandable that in some cases, a
              student simply doesn't have the means to properly plan in a
              concise way their track, even with the assistance of guidance
              counselors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, the initial goal of the project was to provide a proof of
              concept for a website that could allow for counselors to more
              easily track the progress of student, and for students to better
              plan their courses in the future, especially if they need to drop
              a course.
            </p>
            <p>
              Admittedly though, this project was itself in my eyes far more of
              a learning experience in the many realities of software
              development. The amount of research we were doing, the amount of
              pre-planning, lowering of our own expectations and goals, and even
              having to confront our own knowlege and skill. On top of all that,
              having to as best as we can learn and apply concepts like AGILE
              deveopment and just the basics of web devlopment.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, despite my own experiences in this project, I still found
              it thrilling to learn and solve problems. In a way, my wish to
              develop and create software was only strenthened in this project.

            <h2>Previous Website Design</h2>
            <p>
              This was the previous design of my personal website. It acted as
              both an introduction in ReactJS and experiment with GatsbyJS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, because of how often I update this site as it
              stands, I found it a poor choice for continued usage for my own
              purposes. Especially since my site wasn't particularly complex or
              interactive.
